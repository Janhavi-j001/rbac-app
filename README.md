## **Project Title:** Role-Based Access Control app  

This project is a React-based web application that implements **role-based access control (RBAC)** to manage user permissions dynamically. The system assigns users specific roles and displays pages based on their access level.

---

## **Features**
1. **Role-Specific Navigation**  
   - **Admin**: Access to *Dashboard*, *Permissions*, *Roles*, and *Logout*.
   - **Project Manager**: Access to *Dashboard*, *Permissions*, *Roles*, *Projects*, and *Logout*.
   - **Team Member**: Access to *Dashboard*, *Roles*, *Projects*, and *Logout*.

2. **Authentication**  
   - Login and Signup functionality with role selection during registration.
   - Authentication state stored locally for session management.

3. **Dynamic Sidebar & Navbar**  
   - Pages and links adapt based on the logged-in user's role.

4. **Protected Routes**  
   - Routes are secured to ensure only authenticated users can access certain pages.

5. **UI Enhancements**  
   - Clean and responsive design for better user experience.
